                              1. What's DXF
                              =============

   DXF is an exchange format for CAD data.  It was originally created by
Autodesk, Inc. for their well-known product AutoCAD(tm) some 15 years ago 
and developped further with every new AutoCAD(tm) version.

   Nevertheless today there are several thousands of applications around 
which claim to import or export DXF. Among them are nearly every CAD program 
(of course), many DTP and paint programs and lots of others. This viewer is 
one of them.



                          2. How to use the viewer
                          ========================

                           2.1 Getting started
                           -------------------

   You will need a JDK 1.1.x (or newer) compatible version of Java to run 
this program.

   For JDK 1.2 or newer: You can view a DXF file by typing
        java -jar dxfviewer.jar dxffilename

   For JDK 1.1.x: add the jar archive with the viewer classes to your 
class path. Then you can view a DXF file by typing
        java de.escape.quincunx.dxf.DxfViewer dxffilename

   If you want to preset the language you can set the property dxfview.language,
e.g.
	java -Ddxfview.language=de_DE -jar dxfviewer.jar

or for Java 1.1.x:
        java -Ddxfview.language=de_DE de.escape.quincunx.dxf.DxfViewer 

will start the viewer with German user interface without loading a file. 
The default is English.

   For your convenience it's strongly recommended to put this into a script or
batch file. You should have gotten a DOS batch file (named DV.BAT) and an
Unix script (named dv) with the jar archive. With that you can start the 
viewer using 
        dv dxffilename

The viewer can load plain DXF files and DXF files packed with gzip und 
(pk)zip. The files don't need a special extension like .dxf.

   The other way of viewing a file is to load it via the File menu -- as 
usual. The progress of file loading and converting is shown by a growing 
(or sometimes moving) bar.


There are two other properties which you can set via the -D command line switch:

dxfview.reducelines -- an integer value representing the number of lines
                       displayed in reduced display mode.

preview.reducelines -- an integer value representing the number of lines
                       displayed in print preview. 0 selects all lines!


                               2.2 Handling
                               ------------

                                 Moving
                                 °°°°°°
The content of the DXF file is shown as a wireframe model. You can rotate,
move, and scale this model by dragging the mouse over the view window
('dragging' means moving the mouse while pressing a mouse button).
Use different mouse buttons or press CTRL or SHIFT for the different
actions. The active action is shown in the status line below the model
view window.

Use LEFT   mouse button (with no modifier key) to rotate the model.
           While rotating, there is a circle shown. You can imagine a
           trackball lying in this circle. When you drag in the circle,
           you rotate the model like dragging the trackball with the
           mouse. If you drag outside the circle, you rotate the
           model around the view axis. Once you get used to this it
           allows for a perfect control of the view.
Use MIDDLE mouse button (or LEFT with SHIFT) to move the model.
Use RIGHT  mouse button (or LEFT with CTRL) to scale the model and
           to change the distance to the model.


You can change the complexity of the model shown while moving with the
choice in the top right corner.

[Move full]    All lines are drawn while moving (slowest)
[Move BBox]    Only a bounding box of the whole model is moved (fastest)
[Move reduced] Only some of the lines are moved (default)

   
You can step through previous points where you released a mouse button
with the two buttons named [Previous]/[Next].
Reset to [X-Y] resets the view to a view direction parallel to the z axis,
         [Y-Z] parallel to the x axis and 
         [X-Z] parallel to the y axis.


                                 Layer
                                 °°°°°
The data in the DXF file is organized on layers. You can switch them on and
off using the layer list in the bottom right corner. Use the buttons
[Invert] to invert the momentary selection and [Select all] to select 
all of the layers. Layers marked hidden in the DXF file are initially 
hidden.


                               Printing
                               °°°°°°°°
It is possible to print the represented view using the Print item in
the File menu. Printing isn't supported very well in the known Java
versions so don't be too sad if you do not get what you expected.

For those of you with postscript printers there's the possibility of creating
PostScript data directly, which gives much better results than the 
Java1.1-internal printing.


                     Language [Options>Language] 
                     °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
You can switch the language of the viewer between English and German. 
English is the default, see in section 2.1 how to start the viewer with
German user interface. The language is not changed in some system dialogs.

              Coordinate System [Options>Show CS/CS Position]
              °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
It's possible to display a little coordinate system for better orientation.
The corner in which it is display can be varied.

              Swap black & white [Options>Swap Black & White]
              °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
DXF has a black background by default. If you prefer a white background
you can switch to that by using the Options menu.

                    Message Log [Info>Message Log]
                    °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
Here you can see the messages and warnings from the file read process.

                       Model Info [Info>Model]
                       °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
Shows you some rudimentary information about the current model.

                        JVM [Info>Java Stuff]
                        °°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
Shows you some info about the Java Virtual Machine you are running.
This may be useful for bug reports.

                               Leaving
                               °°°°°°°
In case you ever want to leave the program you can use Exit in the File menu.


                              2.3 Applet
                              ----------

   In principle the viewer can be run as an Applet immediately, but several
bugs of internet browsers require a more complicated solution, where parts
of the jar have to be unpacked to the server. The detailed actions and a 
prepared package could be found on the internet page
        http://www.escape.de/users/quincunx/dxfviewer/



                        3. Supported DXF features
                        =========================

   The DXF format is changing with every new release of AutoCAD (tm). 
This viewer understands DXF as written by AutoCAD R12. This is the
most wide-spread version of DXF. 

   AutoDesk has totally changed the DXF format beginning with AutoCAD R13.
The viewer will not display newer DXF versions very well.

This is a table with all DXF entities and wether the viewer supports them
or not.

                             -------

*  Everything above labeled 'not yet supported' waits to get implemented  :-)

*  When there's a common 3D API for Java available shaded models should
   be a nice feature.

*  Printing should get better.

                        ===================

* Thanks to the guys at Sun for giving away the JDK for free.

* This program was developped under Linux. So thanks to the Linux community
  and everybody else who participated for the zillion of years of free work
  which made this possible.

* Special thanks to Frank Gerberding for raytracing the about image on his
  famous PPC powered Amiga.

* Thanks to Tim Niels van der Leeuw who gave me the idea that speeding up
  Java I/O is possible.

* Many thanks to HP Knoll from Paris for supporting me with a binary DXF
  file. Now the viewer understands this rare format, too.

* Thanks to Dietmar Rudolph/Thomas Stürznickel/Leo Weissenberger for writing
  the book "Der DXF-Standard" (ISBN 3-87686-246-9). It was really 
  unrenounceable (and maybe one day I will have found all the errors  ;-)



                            5. License
                            ==========

   Take this program, use it, distribute it.  It's free.  If you are able
to create any damage using it I will be astonished but I will not compensate 
for it.  It's your own risk.

   It's possible to get the sources.  Just write me an email and I will
probably send them to you.  I am just curious who might be interested and
I don't want someone to make some changes and then sell the result as
(or as part of) a commercial product. Here's my address:

                             Bug Reporting
                             °°°°°°°°°°°°°

   If you find a bug first check if it is mentioned below. If not, please
take the time to report it to the address given above. Please add the 
JVM info you can get via the [Info>Java Stuff] menu. If it is possible 
and they are small enough (<1MByte) attach the DXF file with which you
discovered the error. Thank you.

   I am still looking for AutoCAD R14 DXF files. If you have access to 
AutoCAD you can help to improve the DXF Viewer by exporting at least
one normal and one binary DXF file and send them to the given address.

                              Known Bugs
